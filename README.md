# 👋 Hey, I'm Nikhil S.

🎓 Pre-Final Year B.Tech (Information Technology) Student at **SSN College of Engineering**  
📊 Pursuing B.S. in Data Science and Applications at **IIT Madras**  
📍 Chennai, India  

I’m deeply interested in building intelligent systems that combine strong software engineering with data-driven thinking. I enjoy exploring how scalable backend architectures, machine learning, and immersive technologies can come together to solve meaningful real-world problems.

My curiosity lies at the intersection of AI, systems design, and applied analytics — where ideas move beyond theory into practical, deployable solutions. I’m constantly learning, experimenting, and refining my approach to writing clean, efficient, and impactful code.

Outside of tech, I value discipline, creativity, and continuous self-improvement — qualities that shape both my work and mindset.

🚀 Always open to collaborating on innovative and challenging ideas.
